            <p>Coming soon...maybe. For more detailed and deliberate/directed works, the mapping and instrumentation choices may be closely matched in theme, to the source data. In these early experiments however, there is more emphasis on exploring the sound and interface design potential of the <i>Data Operator</i> platform. The forthcoming addition/use of the <i>Composition</i> component is expected to be a more suitable tool for 'data storytelling' with the <i>Data Operator</i>.
