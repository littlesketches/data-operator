    <h2>OE-10: Data from Open Electricity</h2>
    <p>Data for this sonification comes from  <a href='https://openelectricity.org.au/' target="_blank">Open Electricity</a>. It contains daily data about the Australian National Energy Market (NEM), reported at time intervals (at up to 5min resolution) for across multiple data series including volumes of electricity generation by 'source type', and market price (in the NEM). For this sonification, data series are also aggregated by useful category (e.g. fossil fuel vs renewable energy) and various proportions (i.e. ratios) are  calculated. For appropriate use with musical timing, data has been rolled up to a maximum division of 16 steps/sixteenth notes (equivalent to 1.5 hour blocks).
